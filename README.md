# Data Science Coursework 1 #

## Description ##
This was my first of two courseworks representing 40% of the course 'Methods for Data Science' - obtaining a grade of 88.8%. Developed and utilised ML models programmed in Python with NumPy, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn to classify MNIST fashion data and explore group dynamics of social networks in an unsupervised way. Developed custom Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), applied dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF), designed clustering algorithms including graph-based analysis spectral clustering and centralities (PageRank, degree, and eigenvector centrality), and modularity maximisation with the Louvain algorithm.

## Organisation ##
The repository contains:
- A HTML file of the executed code of the coursework with the write up `Alevras01531221_CW1.html`
- A Jupyter Lab file containing the coursework code and the write-up markdown `Alevras01531221_CW1.ipynb`
- A folder with the raw data `./Data/`
